        <h1 id="Monaco-continue-100-start-to-the-season-with-victory-against-Toulouse"><a href="#Monaco-continue-100-start-to-the-season-with-victory-against-Toulouse" class="headerlink" title="Monaco continue 100% start to the season with victory against Toulouse"></a>Monaco continue 100% start to the season with victory against Toulouse</h1><p>Monaco kept up their 100% start to the season with a comfortable victory against Toulouse. Djibril Sidibe got the only goal of the game midway through the first half as Leonardo Jardim’s side continued to look impressive.</p>
<p>The result sees Monaco maintain their five-point lead at the top of Ligue 1, and they will now be looking to make it six wins out of six when they take on Marseille next weekend. For Toulouse, it was another frustrating match as they slipped down to 14th in the table after losing their second game in a row.</p>
<p>The home side started brightly and had chances to take the lead through Jemerson and Radamel Falcao, but they were unable to find a way past Alban Lafont in the Toulouse goal. However, Monaco finally took the lead on 21 minutes when Djibril Sidibe bundled the ball home from close range.</p>
<p>That proved to be enough for Monaco as they saw out the victory comfortably, although Toulouse did have one or two chances late on. All in all, it was an impressive performance from Monaco as they continue their march towards another Ligue 1 title.</p>
<h1 id="PSG-maintain-perfect-home-record-with-win-over-Nantes"><a href="#PSG-maintain-perfect-home-record-with-win-over-Nantes" class="headerlink" title="PSG maintain perfect home record with win over Nantes"></a>PSG maintain perfect home record with win over Nantes</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain extended their perfect home record in Ligue 1 to 12 matches with a 3-1 victory over Nantes on Sunday.</p>
<p>The hosts were ahead after 10 minutes when Neymar scored his 20th league goal of the season, controlling a through ball before firing home.</p>
<p>Kylian Mbappe made it 2-0 four minutes later, slotting home after being set up by Marquinhos, and Neymar added a third early in the second half, superbly volleying past goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu.</p>
<p>Nantes pulled one back through substitute Diego Carlos with 15 minutes remaining, but the result was never in doubt as PSG maintained their 14-point lead at the top of the table.</p>
<h1 id="Lyon-denied-first-win-of-the-season-in-dramatic-fashion"><a href="#Lyon-denied-first-win-of-the-season-in-dramatic-fashion" class="headerlink" title="Lyon denied first win of the season in dramatic fashion"></a>Lyon denied first win of the season in dramatic fashion</h1><p>Lyon’s wait for a first win of the season goes on after conceding a 95th minute equaliser against Strasbourg. Bruno Genesio’s side looked to have sealed all three points when Memphis Depay converted a penalty in the 86th minute, but substitute Stephane Bahoken capitalised on some poor defending to snatch a share of the spoils.</p>
<p>The result leaves Lyon in 12th place in Ligue 1, four points adrift of the top six, while Strasbourg move up to eighth. Lyon had 16 shots on goal compared to Strasbourg’s eight, but only half of those were on target – something that will need to improve if they are to start picking up wins.</p>
<p>Depay was the standout performer for Lyon and his fourth goal of the season was enough to see him named as man of the match. The Netherlands international has now scored in each of his last three appearances for club and country and will be looking to continue that run in next week’s clash with Marseille.</p>
<h1 id="Marseille-suffer-second-successive-defeat"><a href="#Marseille-suffer-second-successive-defeat" class="headerlink" title="Marseille suffer second successive defeat"></a>Marseille suffer second successive defeat</h1><p>After a disappointing home loss to Monaco last weekend, Marseille were looking to get back on track with an away victory against Lorient. However, they could only manage a 1-1 draw, meaning they have now suffered consecutive defeats in all competitions.</p>
<p>It was Lorient who took the lead in the first half, with Benjamin Jeannot scoring from close range. Marseille managed to get back into the game in the second half, with Florian Thauvin equalising from the penalty spot.</p>
<p>Despite plenty of chances for both sides, neither team could find a winning goal and the points were shared. This result leaves Marseille in 4th place in the Ligue 1 table, 5 points behind leaders Monaco.</p>
<p>Next up for Marseille is a home game against Bordeaux, which they will be hoping to win in order to stay in touch with the teams at the top of the table.</p>
<h1 id="Strasbourg-and-Caen-share-the-spoils-in-goalless-draw"><a href="#Strasbourg-and-Caen-share-the-spoils-in-goalless-draw" class="headerlink" title="Strasbourg and Caen share the spoils in goalless draw"></a>Strasbourg and Caen share the spoils in goalless draw</h1><p>The points were shared equally between Strasbourg and Caen as they played out a goalless draw at the Stade de la Meinau. Both teams had chances to win the match, but ultimately failed to find the back of the net.</p>
<p>It was Strasbourg who started the match on the front foot and they created the first real chance of the game in the sixth minute. Jonas Martin played a lovely ball over the top of the Caen defence for Benjamin Corgnet, but his effort was well saved by Rémy Vercoutre.</p>
<p>Caen then started to come into the game and they had two good chances to take the lead. First, Ismaël Diomande’s header was saved by Alexandre Oukidja before Nolan Roux’s effort was blocked by Kenny Lala.</p>
<p>Strasbourg had a good chance to take the lead in the 34th minute when Martin picked out Corgnet inside the area, but he could only fire his effort over the crossbar. Caen also went close minutes later as Diomande’s shot was saved by Oukidja.</p>
<p>The second half continued in much the same way as the first, with both teams creating chances without being able to take advantage. Strasbourg came closest to scoring as Adrien Thomasson’s effort was tipped onto the post by Vercoutre.</p>
<p>In truth, a draw was a fair result from a match that lacked quality in open play.</p>
