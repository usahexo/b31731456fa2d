#  Learn to Play Three Card Poker like a Pro – San Marino Style 

In San Marino, locals play Three Card Poker slightly different than in the United States. Here we explain the basics of the game and how to play like a pro!

Three Card Poker is a casino table game that can be played with up to six players. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either having a higher rank or by making a better poker hand. Unlike standard poker where you are playing against other players, in Three Card Poker you are only playing against the dealer.

To start the game, each player is dealt three cards face down. The dealer is then dealt two cards face down and one card face up. Players can then make one of two bets - either the Ante or Play bet. The Ante bet is a mandatory bet that all players must make and it goes into the pot. The Play bet is an optional bet that players can make on top of their Ante bet.

After all players have placed their bets, the dealer will turn over his/her three cards. The highest ranking hand among both the dealers cards and the player’s cards will win. In case of a tie, neither player wins and the Ante and Play bets are returned to the players. If the player has folded their hand, they do not win or lose anything.

Here are some basic rules on how to play: 

-To win, your hand must rank higher than the dealer's hand - both in terms of rank and poker hands (pair, two pair, etc). 
-If you fold your hand (before seeing your 3rd card), you forfeit your Ante wager  but not your Play wager 
-If you place an Ante wager and your hand ties with dealer's hand, then you neither win nor lose - your Ante & Play wagered amount gets returned to you 
-In order to place a Play wager, you must first place an Ante wager 

The following hands rank from strongest to weakest: 

Royal Flush = Aces through 10s all of same suit 
Straight Flush = 5 sequential cards all of same suit (ex: 2♣ 3♦ 4♥ 5♠) 
Four of a Kind = 4 cards of same rank (ex: Q♣ Q♦ Q♥ J♠) 
Full House = 3 cards of one rank + 2 cards of another rank (ex: K ♦ K♠ 3♥ 3♦) 
Flush = 5 cards all of same suit (ex: 2♦ 4♦ 7♦ 9♦ J♦) 
Straight = 5 sequential cards but not all of same suit (ex: 6♣ 7♦ 8♠ 9♣ 10♥) 
Three of a Kind = 3 cards of same rank (ex: 7♥ 7♦ 2♠) 
Two Pair = 2 different pairs (of different ranks) (ex: K♥ J♦ 10♣ 10♥) 
One Pair = 1 pair (of any rank) (ex: A♥ A♠ 6♥ 6♣) Ace high is lowest possible rank

1) Learn basic strategy – Everyone should learn basic strategy for any casino game they plan on playing. This is because basic strategy gives you the best chance to win over time. In three card poker, there are certain hands that are better than others. For example, always hold two pairs or better. If you don't have any of those hands, then consider folding unless the odds are in your favor. 
2) Use bonus bets – Most casinos offer bonus bets for three card poker. This means that you can make an extra bet on top of your original bet, and if you win, you can earn a bigger payout. For example, one common bonus bet is called "pairplus." With this bet, you are betting that your hand will be a pair or better. So, if you hit a pair or better, you'll win even more money! Always make sure to read about the different bonus bets available before playing so that you can make informed decisions about which ones to make. 
3) Play online – Another great way to improve your chances of winning at three card poker is to play online. This is because online casinos use random number generators (RNGs) to shuffle their decks, so there is no cheating involved like there could be in live games. This means that your chances of winning are just as good online as they would be in a live casino!

#  What You Need to Know to Win at Three Card Poker in San Marino 

There are a few things you should know in order to come out ahead when playing three card poker in San Marino. Here we will go over the basics so you can start winning at the tables today.

The first thing to understand is the ranking of hands. In three card poker, hands are ranked from highest to lowest as follows: 

Straight flush
Four of a kind
Full house
Flush
Straight
Three of a kind 
Two pair 
One pair 
High card


In order to win at three card poker, players need to have one of the following hands: 
- A straight flush (5 cards in sequential order, all of the same suit) 
- Four of a kind (4 cards with the same rank) 
- Full house (3 cards with the same rank and 2 cards with the same rank) 
- Flush (5 cards of the same suit) 
- Straight (3 cards in sequential order but not all of the same suit) 
- Three of a kind (3 cards with the same rank) 
- Two pair (2 different pairs of cards) 
- One pair (1 pair of cards with the same rank) 

Players can also win by having the highest ranked card if their hand doesn’t contain any of the above combinations. So for example, if someone has a King, Queen and Jack as their 3 cards they would have a two pair hand - Ace and two other Kings would beat this. If they only had an Ace they would have a one pair hand -Ace and two other Aces would beat this.
