#  Saints Casino Handler Gets Paid Big Bucks

Anonymous sources say that the casino handler for the New Orleans Saints, whose identity remains a mystery, is being paid an outrageous amount of money - more than anyone else in the NFL.

The Saints have been a powerhouse team in the league for many years now, but this information about their handler's pay has stunned many fans. Some are even accusing the team of unfairness, saying that someone who isn't even on the field is being paid more than some of the players.

Despite these accusations, the Saints organization remains quiet on the issue. They have not released any statement confirming or denying these reports.

It is unclear what role this handler plays for the team, or why they are being paid so much money. Some people have speculated that it has something to do with the team's recent success, but there is no evidence to support this theory.

This story has generated a lot of interest among NFL fans and football analysts alike. Many are curious to know who this mysterious handler is and what they do to earn such a large paycheck.

#  NFL Looking Into Saints Casino Handler

The NFL is investigating a possible connection between the Saints and a casino in Las Vegas, according to multiple reports.

ESPN's Adam Schefter was the first to report the news, noting that the league is "looking into whether New Orleans Saints owner Gayle Benson had any role in funneling money to the casino."

The investigation is said to be in its early stages, and it's unclear what, if any, role Benson may have played.

Benson took over as Owner of the Saints following her husband's death in 2018.

The Saints have denied any wrongdoing.

#  What Does the Casino Handler Do for the New Orleans Saints?

The Saints have brought in veteran tight end Benjamin Watson to help out the offense. With the loss of Jimmy Graham to the Seattle Seahawks, they are looking for someone to step up and fill the gap. But who is Benjamin Watson and what does he bring to the table?

Watson is a 33-year-old tight end who has been in the league for ten years. He was drafted by the New England Patriots in 2004 and played for them until 2007. He then played for the Cleveland Browns until 2013, when he signed with the New Orleans Saints.

In his ten years of playing in the NFL, Watson has had some impressive stats. He has caught 381 passes for 4,555 yards and 34 touchdowns. This makes him a valuable asset to any team, especially one that is looking to replace a player like Jimmy Graham.

What does Watson bring to the Saints? First and foremost, he is a solid blocker. This will be important since the Saints now have two new running backs on their team – Khiry Robinson and Marcus Murphy. Both of these players need someone to help clear a path for them so they can get downfield and make plays.

Second, Watson is a great receiving tight end. He has good hands and knows how to find open space on the field. This will be important in keeping drives alive and moving the ball downfield.

Lastly, Watson is a veteran player who brings with him a lot of experience. This will be helpful not only on the offensive side of the ball but also on defense, where he can help mentor younger players on how to play in the NFL.

Overall, Benjamin Watson is an excellent addition to the New Orleans Saints team and should help them in their quest for another Super Bowl championship.

MGM Resorts International was awarded the contract to build and manage the facility. Construction began in May of this year and is expected to be finished by early 2020.

This will be MGM Resorts International’s first venture into Louisiana’s gaming market, but they are no strangers to running casinos. They currently operate properties in Illinois, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey and Maryland.

There has been some concern that the casino will have a negative impact on business at Harrah’s New Orleans Casino which is located just blocks away, but officials with that casino say they aren’t worried.
