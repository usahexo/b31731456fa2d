#  How to Play Red Dog Casino's Explosive New Game



Red Dog Casino's new game is a surefire hit. It's easy to learn and exciting to play, making it perfect for any gaming enthusiast. In this article, we'll teach you how to play Red Dog Casino's Explosive New Game like a pro.

The basics of the game are simple: you place a bet and are then dealt two cards. If the cards are consecutive, your bet is doubled. If they're of the same value, your bet is paid out at 11 to 1. If neither of these things happen, your bet is put back in the pot and another card is added to the deck. The aim of the game is to predict whether the next card will be higher or lower than the first two.

To start playing, choose your chip value and place your bet on the table. Once you've placed your bet, you'll be dealt two cards face-up. If the cards are consecutive (e.g. 2-3), your bet is doubled automatically. If the cards are of the same value (e.g. two queens), you win 11 times your original bet amount. If neither of these things happen, a third card is added to the deck and turned over. Now you need to decide whether you think the next card will be higher or lower than the first two cards. If you choose correctly, your bet is paid out at even money (1:1). If you choose incorrectly, your bet is lost."

#  Welcome to the Explosive Fun of Red Dog Casino's New Game!

Red Dog Casino is excited to announce the newest addition to our game library: Red Dog poker!

This card game is simple to learn but can provide hours of explosive fun. The basic premise is that you are trying to make a hand that is higher than the dealer's, and in order to do so you will be drawing cards from a single deck.
The rank of the card is important, as Ace is high and Two is low. If you are dealt two cards of the same rank, then your hand will automatically beat the dealer's. In addition, if your first card is an Ace and the second card is a King or lower, then your hand will automatically beat the dealer's.
If you are not happy with your first two cards, you can draw up to two more cards in order to improve your hand. However, if you go over five cards, then you automatically lose even if your hand beats the dealer's.
Once both players have either taken their final cards or decided to stand pat, the hands are compared. The Ace acts as both 1 and 11 points in Red Dog poker (e.g., an Ace and Ten would count as 21 points), so the highest possible hand would be an Ace high (A-K-Q-J-10). The lowest possible hand would be 2-3-4-5-6.
If the player's final hand beats the dealer's, then they win even money on their bet (1:1 ratio). If the player ties with the dealer, then their bet pushes and they get their original stake back. And finally, if the player loses to the dealer, then they lose their entire bet amount. 

Now that you know how to play Red Dog poker, it's time to put your skills to test!
