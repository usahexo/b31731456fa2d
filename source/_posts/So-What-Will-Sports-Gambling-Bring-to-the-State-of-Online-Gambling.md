#  So What Will Sports Gambling Bring to the State of Online Gambling?

The legalization of sports gambling in the United States will have a significant impact on the state of online gambling. The two industries are intertwined, and sports betting is often seen as a gateway to online gambling.

While some states have already legalized sports betting, the Supreme Court’s ruling in May gave states the option to legalize it. This could lead to a surge in online gambling as more states jump on the bandwagon.

The potential for growth is huge. The global online gambling market was worth $44 billion in 2017, and is projected to reach $57 billion by 2020, according to research firm Technavio. The United States accounts for about half of the global market, so there is plenty of room for growth.

The key drivers of this growth are rising income levels and technological advancements. Rising income levels are helping to fuel demand for luxury items such as casino games and sports betting. At the same time, technological advancements are making it easier for people to access online gambling products from anywhere in the world.

The Supreme Court’s ruling is expected to accelerate growth in the online gambling market. This will benefit both consumers and businesses alike. Consumers will have more choice when it comes to where they can gamble, and businesses will be able to tap into a larger pool of customers.

The passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) in 2006 caused a slowdown in the growth of the online gambling market. But with the repeal of that law, we can expect to see even more growth in this sector.

#  Delaware Poised to Lead the Way in Sports Gambling

Delaware is on the brink of becoming the first state in the nation to offer full-scale sports betting.

After the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited most states from authorizing sports betting, Delaware raced to be the first to implement its own regulations. The state's lottery commission has proposed regulations that would allow people over 21 to bet on individual games at casinos and racetracks, as well as online.

The commission is expecting brisk business, estimating that sports betting could generate $7 million in revenue in its first year. That figure could jump to $22 million by year five.

Delaware sees this as an opportunity to capture some of the estimated $150 billion that is wagered illegally on sports every year. Governor John Carney believes that "this new industry will create jobs and spur economic development in our state."

Not everyone is so bullish on sports betting, however. Some lawmakers and church leaders are concerned about the social costs of gambling addiction. They worry that it will lead to more bankruptcies, divorces, and crime.

Despite these concerns, it looks like Delaware is poised to lead the way in legalized sports betting.

#  Sports Betting Poised to Boost State Revenues

A recent study by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission revealed that legalized sports betting could generate as much as $5.6 billion in new revenue for states. If this proves to be the case, it would make sports betting one of the most lucrative forms of legal gambling.

The study also found that, contrary to popular belief, sports betting does not lead to increased crime or bankruptcy rates. In fact, it found that legalized sports betting results in a decrease in problem gambling rates.

This is good news for states that are currently struggling to make ends meet. Nevada, which has had legalized sports betting for many years, is already seeing a boost in revenue from the industry. In fiscal year 2018, casinos in Nevada brought in $1.8 billion from sports betting alone.

It’s clear that legalizing sports betting can be a win-win situation for states and their residents. Not only does it provide a new source of revenue, but it also creates jobs and helps support local businesses. So far, over half of the states in the US have introduced legislation to legalize sports betting. It’s only a matter of time before this becomes a nationwide phenomenon.

#  The Future of Sports Gambling in Delaware

As the US Supreme Court overturned a federal law that banned sports gambling in most states, Delaware is looking to be one of the first states to capitalize on the ruling.

The state already has a well-established horseracing and lottery industry, so it's well-positioned to offer sports betting. Officials are currently devising a plan for how to offer sports wagers, and they're hoping to have something in place by the start of the NFL season in September.

Delaware Governor John Carney said, "This is a great day for Delaware. Our state has been at the forefront of gaming and betting innovation for decades, and I am confident that we will implement a sports betting product that will be both entertaining and popular with Delawareans."

Sports gambling is big business, and Delaware stands to make a lot of money from it. The lottery industry generated more than $217 million in revenue last year, and officials are expecting sports betting to add another $40 million to that total.

Not everyone is happy about this development, however. Some people worry that it will lead to addiction and other social problems. But officials are confident that they can handle things responsibly. Carney said, "We will have strong consumer protections in place, including controls on age and amounts wagered."

With the Supreme Court's decision, the future of sports gambling is now up to the states. Delaware is gearing up for a busy fall season, and it looks like it's poised to take advantage of this new opportunity.

#  How Will Sports Betting Affect Online Gaming?

Since the repeal of PASPA in May, 2018, individual states have been legalizing sports betting. The move is seen as a way to bolster state economies, with tax revenues generated through bookmaking and other related activities. With such legalization comes questions about how it will impact other forms of gaming – specifically, online gaming.

For starters, brick-and-mortar casinos are likely to see a boost in business as sports bettors migrate away from unregulated and often illegal offshore sportsbooks. In addition, casino operators may benefit from being able to offer online gaming products – including poker, casino games and esports – in states where those products are legal.

Separately, there is the question of whether daily fantasy sports (DFS) will be impacted by legalized sports betting. Operators of DFS platforms insist that their offerings are not gambling and should not be affected by the spread of legalized gambling. However, some legal experts believe that DFS may fall within the definition of “gambling” under state law, which could lead to regulatory hurdles for companies offering that product.

Ultimately, it is too early to say definitively how legalized sports betting will affect online gaming. However, given the potential for increased business for brick-and-mortar casinos and the possible regulatory risks for DFS operators, it is clear that this development will have a significant impact on the gaming landscape.
