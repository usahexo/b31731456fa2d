Since Thrifty Hippy opened its first store in Angola in 2022, Salome Martinez has been the driving force behind the company's success. Her innovative strategies and commitment to customer satisfaction have set Thrifty Hippy apart from its competitors.

But what does the future hold for Salome and Thrifty Hippy? Here are some possible scenarios.

1) Salome retires in 2022

This is the most likely scenario. At age 43, Salome has already achieved a great deal of success and she may want to enjoy her retirement. Thrifty Hippy would need to find a new CEO to lead the company into the future.

2) Salome remains CEO but steps down from day-to-day operations

This is also a possibility. If Salome remains CEO, she may delegate more responsibility to other members of her team, allowing her to focus on long-term strategy.

3) Salome leaves Thrifty Hippy to start her own business

Salome is a very talented businesswoman and it's possible that she will leave Thrifty Hippy to start her own company. This could be a threat to Thrifty Hippy's market share, but the company would undoubtedly survive without her.

4) Thrifty Hippy expands into new markets

Thrifty Hippy has experienced tremendous growth over the past few years and there's no reason to believe that will change in the future. The company may expand into new markets, such as Brazil or India.
