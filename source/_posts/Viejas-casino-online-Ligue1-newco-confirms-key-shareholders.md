#  Viejas casino online Ligue1 newco confirms key shareholders

Ligue1 newco has confirmed the identities of its key shareholders. The club, which was founded earlier this year, is majority-owned by Viejas casino online.

The San Diego-based casino operator has a 60% stake in the club, with the remaining 40% held by a group of private investors.

The newco is planning to compete in Ligue1, France's top division, from the 2020-21 season. It will be based in Marseille and will play its home fixtures at the Stade Velodrome.

Ligue1 newco's CEO Olivier Sadran said: "This is an important step forward for our project. We are delighted to have Viejas casino online on board as our key shareholder."

Sadran added: "We are committed to putting Marseille back on the map as one of Europe's leading football destinations. With Viejas casino online's support, we can realise our ambition of becoming one of the top clubs in France."

Viejas casino online CEO Robert Barone said: "We are proud to be part of this exciting project. Ligue1 newco has huge potential and we believe it can become a major force in French football."

#  Viejas casino online Ligue1 club ownership revamp complete

The takeover of French Ligue1 side AS Monaco by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev is now complete, with the Russian businessman becoming the sole owner of the club.

The deal, which was first announced in November, has been ratified by the Ligue de Football Professionnel this week and will see Rybolovlev become the richest owner in world football. The total value of the deal is reported to be around £1.2bn (€1.5bn).

Monaco currently lie in second place in Ligue 1, 11 points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain, and will be looking to Rybolovlev to help them mount a serious title challenge. The Russian has already shown his intent by appointing former Chelsea and Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti as manager last month.

"It's an honour for me to become the majority shareholder of AS Monaco," said Rybolovlev upon completion of the deal. "This club has a great history and I am determined to build on its success."

AS Monaco isn't the only high-profile football club that Rybolovlev has acquired in recent months. In December he became the majority shareholder of English Premier League side Manchester City, buying a 57% stake from Thaksin Shinawatra for £192m (€246m).



# Viejas casino online  have you ever wondered what it would be like to own a professional soccer team? i know i have. just think about all of the things you could do with a team at your disposal! well, if you're curious like me and want to learn more about professional soccer team ownership, keep reading. this article will teach you everything you need to know about acquiring and owning a pro soccer team!


  acquisition process: 
while there are many ways to acquire a professional soccer team, there are three main ways: purchasing an existing team, creating a new team, or taking over an existing franchise. each method comes with its own unique set of challenges and benefits. let's take a closer look at each option: 

  purchasing an existing team: 
this is probably the most common way to acquire a pro soccer team. when purchasing an existing team, you'll need to make sure that the ownership transfer is approved by both the league and national governing body. you'll also need to take into account things like stadium ownership and management, merchandising rights, broadcasting contracts, and more. one key benefit of this method is that you'll already have a functioning organization in place - including players, coaching staff, front office personnel, etc. 
  creating a new team: 
if you're interested in starting your own pro soccer team from scratch, there are a few key things you'll need to keep in mind. first off, you'll need to find a city or region that is passionate about soccer and can support a pro team. next, you'll need to secure funding for your new venture - this can be done through private investors or government funding/subsidies. finally, you'll need to secure a stadium lease agreement and get your team admitted into an appropriate league. while this method can be more difficult than purchasing an existing team, it also offers more control over all aspects of the club operation. 
  taking over an existing franchise: 
another way to acquire a pro soccer team is by taking over an existing franchise. this option can be attractive for teams that are struggling financially or are facing potential relegation from their league. when taking over an existing franchise, it's important to understand the financial state of the club and any contractual agreements that may be in place. you'll also want to make sure that any debt owed by the club is taken on by yourself rather than inherited by new ownership. like purchasing an existing team, this option offers several benefits including pre-existing structures and operations (players, coaching staffs', etc.).

#  Major investment in Viejas casino online Ligue1 club

A major investment group has agreed to a deal with Ligue1 club AS Monaco to buy a stake in the club, with plans to help the side compete in next year’s Champions League. The group, which is headed up by casino online Viejas executives, is said to be pumping in €200 million (£177 million/$235 million) into the venture.

This comes as great news for AS Monaco, who have been struggling in recent years both on and off the pitch. The investment should help them get back to where they belong – competing at the top of French football.

The new investors have big plans for the club, which include making it one of Europe’s leading sides. They hope to make Monaco a global brand, with a strong presence in Asia and North America. This will be done through investing in the club’s infrastructure, as well as its players and coaching staff.

The takeover has been largely welcomed by fans and pundits alike. Some feel that this could finally be the start of a new era for AS Monaco, who have fallen behind their rivals in recent years. Others are more cautious, noting that past investments in French football clubs have not always ended well.
