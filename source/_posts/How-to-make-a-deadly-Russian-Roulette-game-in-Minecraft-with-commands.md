This guide will show you how to make a deadly Russian Roulette game in Minecraft with commands.

To start, you will need to create a Command Block. This can be done by opening the chat window and typing /give @p command_block.

Once you have a Command Block, right-click it and select “Open with Text Editor”. This will open a text editor in which you can type your commands.

Next, you will need to set up your game. The first command is /scoreboard players set <player> winner 0. This sets the player who wins the game to 0 (or any other number, if you want to use a different game).

The next command is /execute as @a[score_winner=0] ~ ~ ~ detect ~ 1 air 0 airstrike_sound @a play summon ~ ~ ~ minecraft: exploded_creeper . This command causes a creeper to explode when the player has 1 air left. You can change the creeper’s name (“exploded_creeper”) and sound (“airstrike_sound”) to whatever you want.

Finally, add the following command to end the game: /kill @a[score_winner=1] . This kills the player who has 1 air left, thus winning the game.

#  How to make Russian Roulette in Minecraft – Instructions with Commands

This is a guide on how to make Russian Roulette in Minecraft using command blocks and piston traps.

To start, you will need the following items:
-6 Piston Traps
-1 Command Block
-12 TNT Blocks
-A Place to Hide
The first thing you need to do is set up your piston traps. For this, you will need 6 piston traps placed in a row, with each trap facing in a different direction. The back of the row should be against a wall or other block that can't be destroyed by TNT. Once the traps are set up, it's time to add the command block. The command block should be placed in the center of the row of pistons.

Next, you will need to set up your TNT blocks. You should place 12 TNT blocks in two rows of six, with each row being two blocks high. The TNT should be placed so that it is touching the back of the row of pistons.

Now it's time to put it all together. To do this, you will need to enter the following command into the command block: /summon FallingSand ~ ~1 ~ {Block:command_block,TileEntityData:{Command:fill ~ ~1 ~ ~7 air}} This will create a falling sand entity that will land on the command block and activate it. When this happens, all of the pistons will retract and all of the TNT will explode, causing damage to anything nearby.
