#  FBI seizes $22 million from offshore gambling site

In a move that is sure to send shockwaves through the online gambling industry, the FBI seized $22 million from an offshore gambling site on Tuesday.

According to federal prosecutors, the site was illegally accepting bets from U.S. customers and had been doing so for years. The site’s owners were charged with conspiracy and operating an illegal gambling business, and face up to five years in prison if convicted.

This is the largest seizure of illegal gambling proceeds in U.S. history, and is sure to put other offshore operators on notice. The FBI has made it clear that it will not tolerate illegal gambling, and will take action against any site that violates U.S. law.

The online gambling industry has been growing rapidly in recent years, but this seizure shows that the authorities are ready to crack down on those who operate outside the law.

#  NJ takes down 5th online casino in 2 years

The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement announced on Monday that it had taken down the fifth online casino in the past two years. This comes as no surprise, as the state has been cracking down on unlicensed online casinos ever since Governor Phil Murphy took office in 2018.

The latest online casino to be shut down was Golden Nugget, which was illegally offering its services to New Jersey residents. In a statement, the DGE said that it had issued a cease and desist order to Golden Nugget and that the casino was ordered to "immediately cease and desist from further operating its online casino within New Jersey."

Golden Nugget is just the latest in a long line of unlicensed online casinos that have been shut down by the DGE. Since Governor Murphy took office, the DGE has seized the domains of four other unlicensed casinos: Ocean Resort Casino, Betfair Casino, Hard Rock Atlantic City, and SugarHouse Casino.

This crackdown on unlicensed casinos is part of Governor Murphy's efforts to legalize and regulate online gambling in New Jersey. In January 2019, Murphy signed into law a bill that would allow licensed casinos in New Jersey to offer online gambling services to residents of the state. The law also allows for new forms of gambling, such as betting on sports and playing poker online.

The goal of this legislation is to provide more options for New Jersey residents who want to gamble, while also generating additional revenue for the state government. So far, the results have been promising. In fiscal year 2019, which ended in June, online gambling generated $260 million in revenue for New Jersey. This was an increase of 26 percent over fiscal year 2018.

It remains to be seen whether this trend will continue, but it seems likely that New Jersey's regulated online gambling market will only grow larger in the years ahead. Thanks to its robust infrastructure and well-regulated environment, New Jersey is quickly becoming a leading destination for online gambling enthusiasts from all over the world.

#  Gambling sites increase advertising as profits soar

gambling sites are increasing advertising as profits soar. industry research shows that in 2017, online gambling was a $49.3-billion global industry, and it is estimated to grow to $64.5 billion by 2020. with such a large market, gambling sites are keen to increase their exposure and attract new customers.

one way they are doing this is by increasing their advertising budgets. in the uk, for example, the gambling advertising spend rose by 11% in 2018, reaching £236 million. this was partly due to a number of high-profile gambling adverts aired during the world cup.

online gambling has become increasingly popular in recent years, thanks to the convenience and flexibility it offers. players can gamble from anywhere at any time, using their mobile devices or laptops. this has led to a proliferation of gambling sites, which have been eager to grab a slice of the lucrative market.

but as the market becomes more competitive, gambling sites are having to resort to increasingly aggressive marketing tactics. this has included targeting vulnerable groups such as children and problem gamblers.

one concern is that the growth in advertising could lead to an increase in problem gambling rates. previous research has shown that when there is more advertising for gambling, there is also an increase in problem gambling rates.

the uk’s regulatory body for gambling, the Gambling Commission, has expressed concern about the “considerable growth” of online casinos targeting British players. its director general, Neil McArthur, said: “As part of our review we will be considering whether further measures are required to protect consumers, including restricting how these businesses can advertise their products”.

it will be interesting to see if the commission decides to take any further action to restrict gambling advertising. given the amount of money involved in the industry, it is unlikely that advertisers will stop targeting potential customers anytime soon

#  Pennsylvania cracks down on illegal online gambling

Pennsylvania has been cracking down on illegal online gambling in recent months, as state officials work to halt the activity ahead of the launch of new, legal sports betting in the state.

Last week, Pennsylvania’s Attorney General announced that the office had shut down more than two dozen unlicensed online gambling websites. The move comes as the state prepares for the launch of its new sports betting market, which is set to go live on July 15th.

“Online gambling is illegal in Pennsylvania, and my office is committed to shutting down these unlicensed websites and keeping our citizens safe,” Attorney General Josh Shapiro said in a statement last week.

Shapiro added that the crackdown is part of “a larger effort to combat illegal gambling in our state ahead of the launch of legal sports betting.”

Pennsylvania became one of the first states in the US to legalize online sports betting earlier this year, after a federal law legalizing the activity nationwide was struck down by the Supreme Court. The state is now gearing up for its official launch of sports betting on July 15th, with ten casinos expected to offer it initially.

However, officials say that they will not tolerate any illegal gambling activity in Pennsylvania – including illegal online sports betting. In addition to announcing last week’s crackdown on unlicensed websites, state officials have also put together a task force to investigate and prosecute illegal gambling operations in Pennsylvania.

The task force will be chaired by Secretary Jeannie Williams of the Department of Revenue and will include representatives from a number of other agencies, including the Attorney General’s Office, the State Police, and the Gaming Control Board.

Williams said that her department is “committed to working with our partners across government to protect Pennsylvanians from those who attempt to break our laws and avoid paying taxes.”

#  Canada repeals law allowing online gambling

In a surprise move, the Canadian government has repealed a law that allowed online gambling. The law, which came into effect in 2015, was seen as a way to bring in extra revenue for the government. However, it was met with criticism from lobby groups who argued that it would lead to more problem gambling.

Now, the government says that it is repealing the law because of concerns about the level of problem gambling. A spokesperson for the government said that “the potential risks posed by online gambling are too great” and that “we need to do everything we can to protect vulnerable people from harm.”

The decision has been welcomed by lobby groups such asProblem Gambling Canada, who have long campaigned for a repeal of the law. Christina Famularo, the group’s director of public policy, said that “problem gambling is a serious issue and we applaud the government for its decision to repeal this harmful legislation.”

However, there has been criticism of the decision from the gaming industry, which says that it will cost jobs and investment in Canada. The CEO of Playnow Online, a Canadian gaming company, said that “the repeal of this legislation is a step in the wrong direction and will hurt our economy.” He added that “Canada is already at a disadvantage compared to other countries when it comes to online gambling and this move will only make things worse.”
