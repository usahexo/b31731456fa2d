#  Shock as Reyer Venezia player caught gambling

Reyer Venezia's captain, 40-year-old Slovenian forward Klemen Prepelic, has been caught gambling on basketball games, according to allegations made by the team's owner in a press conference on Thursday.

"It is with great regret that I must announce that our captain, Klemen Prepelic, has been caught gambling on basketball games," said owner Maurizio Zamparini. "This is a terrible betrayal of the club and its fans.

"Klemen has been a part of this team for many years and we are all shocked by his behaviour. He has admitted to placing bets on games and he will be punished accordingly."

Zamparini did not specify the amount of money involved in the gambling but he did say that it was more than what the team could afford to lose.

"Klemen is a good player but his actions have put the future of this club in jeopardy," added Zamparini. "We will now have to focus on rebuilding without him."

The news comes as a huge surprise as Prepelic is considered one of the most experienced players in Italy's top division and is also the captain of Slovenia's national team. He had never been accused of any misdemeanours before.

Reaction to the news has been mixed with some fans calling for Prepelic to be banned for life while others are arguing that he deserves a second chance.

#  Gambling is a sin – says Reyer Venezia coach

The head coach of Reyer Venezia, Eugenio Dalmasson, believes that gambling is a sin and has forbidden his players from indulging in any form of betting.

“Gambling is a sin, I have always felt that way and I have always told my players the same thing. When you gamble, you are not only risking your own money, but also the money of your family and your friends. It’s not worth it,” said Dalmasson.

Reyer Venezia is an Italian basketball club that was founded in 1929. The team competes in the Lega Basket Serie A (LBA), the top-tier professional basketball league in Italy.

Dalmasson took over as head coach of the club in 2016 and has led them to two consecutive appearances in the playoffs. In both of those playoff appearances, they were eliminated in the first round.

This year, the team has struggled and currently sits in 12th place in the 16-team league with a record of 10 wins and 10 losses.

The head coach’s strict rules about gambling have not gone over well with some of the players on the team. Marco Belinelli, who is currently playing for the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA, expressed his displeasure with Dalmasson’s policies.

“It’s hard to hear that you can’t do something that everyone else is doing. It creates a different kind of pressure, but I understand where he is coming from. He is just trying to protect us and our families,” said Belinelli.

Despite some player dissent, Dalmasson insists on enforcing his rules about gambling and believes that it is important for his players to stay away from it.

#  Where inside the bible is gambling a sin? Reyer Venezia ask fans

MILAN – After the impressive victory against Avellino, Reyer Venezia fans asked head coach Walter De Raffaele about the status of gambler within the Bible.

“The Bible doesn’t specifically forbid gambling, but it does warn against the many dangers and sins that can accompany it: greed, jealousy, anger, pride, and so on. So while gambling itself may not be a sin, it could lead to other sins. Christians are called to live lives of holiness and purity, and we are warned against anything that might lead us away from that goal.”

Biblical scholar Dr. Troy Schmidt adds, “Gambling can be seen as a form of idolatry – placing our trust in something other than God. It can also lead to greed and poverty, as well as violence and other forms of crime. The Bible is clear that we are not to put our trust in money or material things – they can never truly satisfy us. In the end, only God can satisfy our deepest desires.”

So while gambling may not be specifically condemned in the Bible, there are many good reasons why Christians should avoid it. Our ultimate goal should be to please God above all else.

#  Are Reyer Venezia betting on their own games?

There are now allegations of match-fixing against Reyer Venezia floating about, and it could not have come at a worse time. The team is in the midst of a heated playoff race, with their spot in the postseason crucial to their chances of competing in next year’s Champions League.

The first reports of possible match-fixing came out on Wednesday, when journalist Claudio Zulian took to Twitter to accuse Reyer Venezia of rigging their own games. Zulian’s evidence was a screenshot of a conversation between two people he claimed were involved in the match-fixing scheme. The screenshot appears to show one person discussing how they will make sure Reyer Venezia loses their game against Pallacanestro Trieste the following day.

Reyer Venezia released a statement denying any involvement in match-fixing, but the allegations have continued to circulate. The timing of these allegations is especially bad for Reyer Venezia, as they could result in sanctions from both the Italian Basketball Federation (FIP) and Euroleague Basketball if found guilty.

This is not the first time that allegations of match-fixing have rocked Italian basketball. In 2015, former players from Serie A clubs notified authorities about an alleged match-fixing ring that was operating in the country. And in 2017, three players from Italy’s top league were given prison sentences for their involvement in a match-fixing scheme.

#  Gambling charges weigh heavy on Reyer Venezia

Italian basketball team Reyer Venezia is facing some heavy gambling charges. The team’s president, Stefano Gambarota, and its coach, Walter De Raffaele, have been charged with illegal gambling and sports betting.

This comes as a huge blow to the team, which is currently in second place in the Italian League. Officials believe that as much as €2 million (US$2.3 million) may have been wagered on games involving Venezia in the past two years.

Both men deny any wrongdoing and say that they are innocent of the charges. However, if found guilty, they could face up to five years in prison.

This isn’t the first time that gambling charges have rocked the world of Italian basketball. In 2016, former head coach of Serie A side Virtus Bologna, Carlo Recalcati, was sentenced to one year in prison for placing bets on games involving his own team.
