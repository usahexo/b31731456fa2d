#  Mohawk Casino employs 1,000 staff members 

The Mohawk Casino is a popular tourist destination in Ontario, Canada. It employs 1,000 people and is one of the largest employers in the region. The casino has a variety of games and entertainment options, including slot machines, table games, restaurants, and a theater.

The casino was founded in 1996 by the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake. The council is a self-governing First Nation that oversees the territory around the casino. The casino has been a major boon to the local economy, providing jobs and revenue to the community.

The casino has faced some criticism in the past due to its proximity to Montreal. Some residents of Montreal have argued that the casino has had a negative impact on their city. However, the Mohawk Council has disputed these claims and argues that the casino has been a positive for the region overall.

#  One-third of Mohawk Casino employees are from the Akwesasne Nation 

When the Mohawk Casino first opened its doors in 1992, only a handful of Akwesasne Mohawks were employed there. Now, almost a third of the casino's employees are Akwesasne tribal members.

The close ties between the casino and the Akwesasne Nation can be traced back to the casino's early days, when then-tribal chief Stacey LaForme helped to negotiate the casino's lease with the provincial government. LaForme saw the casino as an opportunity for his people to create jobs and improve their economic prospects.

Today, many Akwesasne Mohawks work in a wide variety of positions at the casino, from dealers and waitstaff to executives and managers. The casino has been a boon for the community, providing stable employment and generating much-needed revenue for social services and other community groups.

It's not just the tribe that has benefited from the casino. The entire region has seen tremendous growth since the Mohawk Casino opened its doors. Restaurants, hotels, and other businesses have sprung up to serve the needs of casino visitors. The positive impact of the casino on the local economy has been nothing short of remarkable.

The Mohawk Casino is a key part of Akwesasne culture and economy, and it is sure to play a role in both for many years to come.

#  New casino means jobs for Hogansburg and surrounding areas 

The new Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Resort is bringing much needed jobs to Hogansburg and the surrounding areas. The casino, which is set to open in early 2019, is expected to create 1,000 jobs. These include positions in hospitality, food service, and gaming. 

Mohawk Council of Akwesasne Grand Chief Abram Benedict said the new casino will have a "significant impact" on the local economy. He praised the project for its "multi-million dollar investment" and for creating much-needed jobs. 

The resort will also feature a hotel, spa, and conference center. This will be a major boon for the area, which has long struggled with unemployment. In fact, the unemployment rate in Franklin County (where Hogansburg is located) is more than twice the state average. 

The opening of the new casino is sure to help address this issue. It will provide much-needed jobs and help to spur economic growth in the area. This will be a welcome development for Hogansburg and its residents.

#  Mohawk Casino Hogansburg employs 300 more people than its Akwesasne counterpart 

When it comes to casino employment in the region of Akwesasne, there’s just no comparison between the Mohawk Casino Hogansburg and the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino.

Since it opened in 2000, Mohawk Casino Hogansburg has employed 300 more people than its Akwesasne counterpart. The tribal-owned casino on the U.S. side of the border currently employs 750 people, while the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino has 450 employees.

The difference is due in part to the fact that Mohawk Casino Hogansburg is much newer than the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino, which dates back to 1993. But also key is the different business models of the two casinos.

Mohawk Casino Hogansburg is a commercial casino, while the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino is a not-for-profit organization. That means profits from Mohawk Casino Hogansburg go back into the casino itself or are shared among its shareholders, while profits at the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino are used to fund social and economic development programs for the tribe.

Asked about the difference in casino employment, Mohawk Casinos CEO David Smith said it was simply a matter of dollars and cents.

“Akwesasne is a great operation with an experienced team, but our model is different,” he said in an email to The Daily Princetonian. “We are a for-profit business that returns money to our shareholders, whereas Akwesasne is a not-for-profit that uses its profits for social and economic development programs for its members.” 

Smith also noted that his casino has created more than 2,000 jobs in total since it opened, including jobs at restaurants, hotels and other businesses in the area that benefit from increased traffic.
