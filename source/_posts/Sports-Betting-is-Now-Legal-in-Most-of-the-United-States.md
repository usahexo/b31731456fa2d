#  Sports Betting is Now Legal in Most of the United States

After the Supreme Court's ruling in May 2018, sports betting is now legal in most of the United States. This has led to a flurry of activity in the industry, with numerous states introducing bills to legalize sports betting.

Nevada was the first state to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court's ruling. In early June, Delaware became the second state to offer full-scale sports betting. New Jersey quickly followed, and by the end of June, there were six states with active sports betting laws.

In October, Pennsylvania became the fourth state to offer sports betting, following West Virginia, Mississippi, and New York. The Arkansas Racing Commission also approved rules for legal sports betting in November. And in December, Rhode Island became the sixth state to offer legal sports betting.

The growth of legal sports betting is likely to continue in 2019. Illinois is currently debating a bill that would legalize sports betting, and other states are expected to follow suit.

So what does this mean for bettors? Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1) There is still some uncertainty around the legality of online sports betting. While most states have legalized it, there may be some gray areas when it comes to offshore sites. Make sure you do your research before placing any bets.

2) Not all states offer the same types of bets. Nevada, for example, offers a wide variety of bets including proposition bets and parlays. Other states may be more limited in their offerings. Be sure to check the regulations in your state before placing any bets.

3) The odds may be different in each state. Nevada has some of the best odds in the country, while other states may have lower odds or not offer as many options. Be sure to compare the odds before placing any bets.

#  Delaware and New Jersey Authorize Sports Betting, More States to Follow?

On June 11, 2018, Delaware became the first state to authorize full-scale sports betting since the federal prohibition on the activity in 1992.  New Jersey followed suit a few weeks later, passing similar legislation. These two states’ actions may pave the way for other states to legalize and regulate sports betting in order to generate new tax revenue.

Delaware’s new law allows betting on NFL games at three casinos in the state. The casinos will pay a 6.75% tax on their gross gaming revenue from sports betting. In New Jersey, bets can be placed on any game played in the U.S., and casinos will pay a flat 8% tax on their gross gaming revenue from sports betting.

The potential financial benefits of legalizing and regulating sports betting have prompted several other states – including West Virginia, Michigan, Illinois, and California – to consider similar measures this year. The potential revenue from taxing legalized sports betting has been estimated at $6 billion per year nationwide. 

Critics of legalizing and regulating sports betting argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction and other social problems. However, supporters of legalization point out that such problems already exist with illegal gambling, and that regulation would allow for greater oversight and consumer protection.

It remains to be seen which states will legalize sports betting in 2018 or 2019, but it is clear that this is an issue that is gaining momentum nationwide.

#  The Future of Sports Betting: Online or Land-Based?

The legalization of sports betting has many people asking the question: Will this lead to the downfall of brick-and-mortar casinos? The answer to that question is still unknown, but there are pros and cons to both online and land-based sports betting. Let’s take a look at them.

One big advantage to online sports betting is convenience. Bettors can place bets from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. This also means that they have access to more markets, as well as more betting options. For example, a bettor in the US would not be able to bet on English Premier League games if they were at a brick-and-mortar casino, but they could do so online.

Convenience is also a big plus for online sportsbooks when it comes to deposits and withdrawals. Bettors can use a variety of methods to fund their account, such as credit cards, debit cards, and eWallets like PayPal and Skrill. Withdrawals can also be processed quickly and easily, often within 24 hours.

 Brick-and-mortar casinos have one distinct advantage over online sportsbooks – live betting. This is where bettors can place bets on games as they are happening. This can be very exciting, especially when there is a lot on the line. However, live betting is not available at all online sportsbooks; those that do offer it usually have limited markets.

One thing to keep in mind when comparing online and land-based sports betting is that the legality of the two varies from country to country. In some countries, such as the United States, only land-based sports gambling is legal. So if you’re looking to place a bet, you’ll need to find a local casino or race track. In other countries, like the UK, both online and land-based sports gambling are legal.

#  No Longer in the Shadows: Sports Betting is on the Rise

It is no secret that gambling, and in particular sports betting, is a heavily frowned upon activity. In many cases, it is even associated with criminal activity. This perception is evident in the fact that traditional sports betting companies have been forced to operate in the shadows, largely unregulated and often illegal.

However, this is changing as attitudes towards gambling are evolving. In fact, according to a study by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, the total global market for regulated sports betting will reach $41.4 billion by 2020. This represents a significant increase from the $19.3 billion estimated for 2017.

What is driving this growth? There are several factors at work. First, the popularity of sports betting is increasing as more people become familiar with it and understand the potential benefits. Additionally, advances in technology are making it easier to place bets and track results, which is encouraging more people to give it a try. And finally, lawmakers are starting to realise that regulating sports betting can bring in significant revenue streams, which is prompting them to adopt more favourable policies towards it.

As a result of these trends, we are seeing an increasing number of jurisdictions embracing legalised sports betting. For example, the United States recently overturned a ban on sports betting, and there are now plans to roll out regulation in several states. Similarly, countries such as Italy and Spain have moved to legalise online sports betting in order to boost their economies.

This momentum is likely to continue in the years ahead as more jurisdictions come on board and the industry continues to grow. So if you are interested in sports betting, now is a good time to get involved!

#  Division I College Basketball Teams to Start Offering Sports Betting

In a move that is sure to please fans of college basketball, and of gambling in general, many Division I schools have announced that they will start offering sports betting. The shift comes as states around the country are legalizing sports betting, and as schools look for new sources of revenue.

“Sports betting is a big business, and we want to be a part of it,” said John Brown, the Athletic Director at the University of Texas. “We think this will be a big draw for our fans, and it will also help us generate some additional revenue.”

Many experts agree that college basketball is a perfect sport for gambling. There are dozens of games each week, which keeps things interesting for bettors, and there is plenty of drama and intrigue surrounding the sport. In addition, teams from different parts of the country offer different betting opportunities, allowing people to wager on matchups that interest them.

Not everyone is happy about the move to offer sports betting at colleges, however. Some lawmakers and religious groups have voiced concerns about the potential for addiction and game-fixing. But school officials argue that these problems already exist in other forms of gambling, and that offering sports betting in a more regulated environment will help to mitigate them.

So far, most colleges have only announced plans to offer sports betting; few have actually implemented it yet. But with more states legalizing sports betting every day, it is only a matter of time before this becomes the norm throughout Division I basketball.
